                <h4>Jan.02.2025</h4>
                <p>I am excited to share that my PhD journey has gained new sponsors: 
                    Intuitive Machines, Michelin, and NASA, as part of the Moon Racer 
                    project.
                    Intuitive Machines, the prime contractor for the Lunar Terrain Vehicle 
                    Services Feasibility Assessment, 
                    will be the primary sponsor supporting the continuation of my PhD 
                    study. My R&D work will focus on developing a high-performance, 
                    high-fidelity simulation engine for whole-vehicle dynamics, 
                    incorporating multi-threaded CPU and GPU architectures. 
                    This engine will simulate deformable terrain, lunar regolith, and 
                    deformable airless tires, advancing the technology needed for lunar 
                    exploration. For more details, visit <a href="https://www.intuitivemachines.com/post/intuitive-machines-unveils-moon-racer-ltv" target="_blank">https://www.intuitivemachines.com/post/intuitive-machines-unveils-moon-racer-ltv</a>.

                <h4>Dec.09.2024</h4>
                <p>Our publication, "Human-Machine Interaction in Automated Vehicles: Reducing Voluntary Driver
                    Intervention",
                    has been selected and accepted by
                    "Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies". The journal has a high impact factor of
                    7.6. This
                    research was conducted on driving simulators running Chrono::HIL middleware, a research-oriented
                    project
                    developed for my master's thesis. Chrono::HIL is an open-source middleware for distributed vehicle
                    dynamics
                    simulation, built upon C++/DDS/CUDA with sensor simulation and X-in-the-loop support. This
                    publication
                    showcased that the project I handrolled is comparable to commercial solutions such as <a

                <h4>May.23.2024</h4>
                <p>I passed my PhD Preliminary Exam on May 23rd, 2024. I would like to give
                    special thanks to my PhD committee members - Prof. Dan Negrut, Prof. Josiah Hanna, Prof. Wei Wang,
                    Prof. Xiangru Xu, and Prof. Jinlong Wu.

                    My PhD work focuses on designing and architecting a scalable robotics simulator with distributed
                    multi-physics simulation leveraging heterogeneous computing. I aim to make efforts to increase the
                    predictive power of robotics simulators, and enable multi-robot imitation and reinforcement learning
                    in complex environments, driven by physics-based simulations. Additionally, I anticipate that part
                    of my PhD work will contribute to bridging the gap between simulation and reality in a multi-agent
                    context.</p>
