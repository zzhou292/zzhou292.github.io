                <h4>Dec.09.2024</h4>
                <p>Our publication, "Human-Machine Interaction in Automated Vehicles: Reducing Voluntary Driver
                    Intervention",
                    has been selected and accepted by
                    "Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies". The journal has a high impact factor of
                    7.6. This
                    research was conducted on driving simulators running Chrono::HIL middleware, a research-oriented
                    project
                    developed for my master's thesis. Chrono::HIL is an open-source middleware for distributed vehicle
                    dynamics
                    simulation, built upon C++/DDS/CUDA with sensor simulation and X-in-the-loop support. This
                    publication
                    showcased that the project I handrolled is comparable to commercial solutions such as <a

                    of
