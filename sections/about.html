    <p>
      I am a PhD student, focusing on Embodied AI and Simulation at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, double majoring in Computer Science and
      Mechanical Engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm an experienced c++ developer, with a focus on robotics and autonomous vehicle control design, AI/ML Infra,
      physics-based simulation, and game development.
    </p>

    <p>
      My research focuses on the development and validation of digital twins and their applications in the design
      of
      autonomy stacks for robotic systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructure. My research experiences
      have allowed me to develop strong
      programming skills, knowledge in high-performance computing, deep understandings in multi-body dynamics and
      physics simulation, and computer graphics. I am a member of the Simulation-Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) at
      the
      University of Wisconsin-Madison, and an active developer of the open-source multi-physics simulation engine
      Project Chrono.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have worked with technologies such as C++, C for Embedded Systems, Python, ROS, MySQL, Java, Embedded
      Software, Docker, SolidWorks, and Ansys. I have served/received financial sponsorships from 
      US federal research institutions such as NASA, DOD, and NHTSA, 
      R&D branch of large-cap technology companies such as Toyota Research Institue and Tesla,
      and software branch of large industrial companies such as Alstom and Milwaukee Tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am passionate about developing complex applications that solve real-world problems impacting millions of
      users.
    </p>
