    <p>
      I am a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, double majoring in Computer Science and
      Mechanical Engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm an experienced c++ developer, with a focus on robotics and autonomous vehicle control design,
      physics-based simulation, and game development. I enjoy problem-solving and coding. Always strive to bring
      100% to the work I do.
    </p>

    <p>
      My research focuses on the development and validation of digital twins and their applications in the design
      of
      autonomy stacks for robotic systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart infrastructure. My research experiences
      have allowed me to develop strong
      programming skills, knowledge in high-performance computing, deep understandings in multi-body dynamics and
      physics simulation, and computer graphics. I am a member of the Simulation-Based Engineering Lab (SBEL) at
      the
      University of Wisconsin-Madison, and an active developer of the open-source multi-physics simulation engine
      Project Chrono.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have worked with technologies such as C++, C for Embedded Systems, Python, ROS, MySQL, Java, Embedded
      Software, Docker, SolidWorks, and Ansys.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am passionate about developing complex applications that solve real-world problems impacting millions of
      users.
